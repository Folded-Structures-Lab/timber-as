# About

*timberas* is a Python package developed to support research and design of Australian timber structures. It can be used to determine the section properties, materials properties, and design capacities for structural members as per Australian Standard AS1720.1:2020 (Timber Structures Part 1: Design Methods). 

*timberas* is developed by [Dr Joe Gattas](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/9443)  and research collaborators at the [University of Queensland](https://civil.uq.edu.au/) and [ARC Advance Timber Hub](https://www.advance-timber-hub.org/).
